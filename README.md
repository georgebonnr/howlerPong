Pong that will amuse you and annoy others


Uses the famous framework, js, and [my webaudio library](https://github.com/georgebonnr/gunther.js) to implement voice-controlled pong.

Tip: Try controlling your paddle with changes in pitch ('swoops') rather than fixed pitches.  Better control, and you sound extra ridiculous.
